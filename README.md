## graph 1: luminousity in comparison to mass of stars closest to the Sun
- 20 of the closest stars to the Solar System and if there is any correlation between their luminousity in comparison to total mass, and if it's radius has anything to do with it
- I found a pattern of exponential growth in terms of mass and it's function luminousity, showing that the larger the mass is, the luminousity is going to increase at a much higher rate, and the larger the values of both the x and y axis, the larger the radius will be in terms of the Sun
